Have you ever looked at the daily background on Bing or the version on your desktop? Did you stop and wonder where that beautiful landscape or haunting castle is? Perhaps you turned to a colleague and said “I wonder where that is? Where do you think”. Then you did the same the next day and perhaps another colleauge joined in. This then turned in to a game amongst the team. Then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and soon the whole company was playing. Suddenly, a little bit of fun was taking up loads of time for the poor person who first came up with the idea.

This little tale inspired me to take a look at making a Bot in Teams that could do the same thing but with more automation. What would a Bot look like that could ask someone to choose an image and then send it round to the team, allow them to guess where it is, work out which guess was closest and then set a winner. Well, you will be happy to know that I can tell you now. It looks like the Where on Earth Bot.

Except that was then. That was with the first Bot Framework. Then I decided that a Power Platform version was needed. Hence Where on Earth Power Platform was born.

To learn more about the Bot itself, please see the Documentation/Wiki link above as well as the deployment and architecture guides.
